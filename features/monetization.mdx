## Credit System Overview

### What are Credits?
Credits are the currency used on Pactory. Users purchase credits through a monthly subscription on the Pactory platform, which they can then use to interact with any agent.

### Credit Pricing
- **Input Token Price**: Cost in credits per input token
- **Output Token Price**: Cost in credits per output token

## Trial Credits

### How Trial Credits Work
- Each new user receives trial credits automatically
- Trial credits can only be used with agents that have trial credits option enabled
- Once trial credits end, users need to purchase credits to continue

## Revenue Calculation

1. User sends a message (input tokens)
2. Agent responds (output tokens)
3. Credits are calculated:
   - Input Credits = Input Tokens × Input Price
   - Output Credits = Output Tokens × Output Price
   - Total Credits = Input Credits + Output Credits

## Platform Fees

<Warning>
Pactory charges a 20% platform fee on all paid transactions. For example:
- Transaction total: 1000 credits
- Platform fee (20%): 200 credits
- Your earnings: 800 credits
</Warning>

## Payouts

### Setup Process
Payouts are processed bi-weekly using [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect). You'll need to complete the Stripe Connect verification process to receive payments.

### Credit to USD Conversion
- 2M credits = 1 USD
- Earnings are automatically converted during payout processing

<Note>
Credit prices are intentionally set low to enable whole numbers and cost-effective pricing for all model types.
</Note>

### Stripe Connect States

Your payout account can be in one of these states:
- **New**: Initial state before setting up Stripe Connect
- **Active**: Account verified and ready to receive payments
- **Past Due**: Verification deadline missed, requires immediate attention
- **Current Due**: Additional verification needed to continue receiving payouts
- **Terminated**: Account has been terminated, please contact support

<Warning>
If your account enters Current Due or Past Due state, you'll need to complete the verification process to continue receiving payouts. For Terminated accounts, please contact support at hi@pactory.ai
