  <Step title="Configure Integration">
    Enter your Voker-specific configuration:
    - API endpoint URL (required)
    - API key (required)

    Note that:
    - Only text input via the "question" field is supported
    - Only text output is supported (no structured output)

## API Configuration

Your Voker AI tool needs to be properly configured for API access. The platform handles all the API calls automatically. Please ensure your Voker agent is configured as a prediction-type model that accepts a text input ("question" field) and returns a text output.
